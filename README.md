# My BASH Config

I needed to organise my bash config a bit. This is the result.

## How to use

Clone the repository into your hope directory

    git clone <url> .bashconfig

Include it into your `.bashrc`

    source ~/.bashconfig/config.bash

## What's included

1. Bunch of aliases
2. Directory marking script (that I copied from somewhere ...)
3. WP-cli autocomplete script
